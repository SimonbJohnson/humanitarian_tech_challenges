#PCoding API

Status: Unclaimed

Humanitarian have unique codes for places to make joins easier between data sets.  Often these are missing and it is a manual process to add.  An api to automatically add these based on fuzzy matching/machine learning and alternative spellings would be useful.
It would be great for the solution to be web based API and able to integrate with current HXL workflows.

Data sources: ITOS, Humanitarian Data Exchange.
