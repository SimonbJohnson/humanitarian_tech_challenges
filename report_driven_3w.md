##Report driven who, what, where (3W)

#Overview
The 3W is standard product in disaster and humanitarian response.  Itâ€™s a spreadsheet declaring who is working in what sectors or activities in geo admin boundaries.  The standard way to display the information is a static map or a dashboard.  The static map is restricted as it organises the data by only one of the three possible dimensions.  The dashboard has had slow adoption as non-technical users find it hard to use.

The report driven 3W attempts to fix the above problems. It will dynamically generates 3W reports based on 3W data, geo and user selected filters to produce a text report with embedded maps and tables.
