#HXL Tagging API

The number of HXL data sets is growing with over 1000 on HDX.  Do we have enough critical mass in the variation of data to start to apply machine learning on predicting tags on untagged datasets.

The algorithm should look at the headers associated with tags, the data associated with tags, the data type in the column and placement within the datasets (e.g. who are the columns neighbours)

An analysis carried out on whether any tags have enough training data to predict?
